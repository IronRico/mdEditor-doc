## 19115-2 iso

ISO 19115-2:2009 extends the existing geographic metadata standard by defining the schema required for describing imagery and gridded data. It provides information about the properties of the measuring equipment used to acquire the data, the geometry of the measuring process employed by the equipment, and the production process used to digitize the raw data. This extension deals with metadata needed to describe the derivation of geographic information from raw data, including the properties of the measuring system, and the numerical methods and computational procedures used in the derivation. The metadata required to address coverage data in general is addressed sufficiently in the general part of ISO 19115.  \(International Organization for Standardization \(2009\). ISO 19115-2:2009.

## JSON

Javascript Object Notation, a general purpose format like CSV.

## Keywords

Words used in an information retrieval system to indicate the content of a document.

## Metadata

Metadata is a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.

## Metadata Repositories

A server where metadata is published to.

## mdJSON File

A type of JSON file that is propitary to the Metadata toolkit developed by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group \(ADIWG\), learn more at \[[https://adiwg.github.io/mdTools/](https://www.gitbook.com/book/adiwg/mdeditor/edit#)\].

## mdEditor File

A mdJSON file created by mdEditor that contains all of the information contained in mdJSON, along with mdEditor settings. This can be exported and shared with collaborators, imported into another record set, or saved to a local workstation as a backup or archival copy.

## ParentID

Identifier for a folder on a database where records will be stored upon publishing.

## ScienceBase

A USGS collaborative scientific data and information management platform used directly by science teams. ScienceBase provides access to aggregated information derived from many data and information domains, including feeds from existing data systems, metadata catalogs, and scientists contributing new and original content. ScienceBase architecture is designed to help science teams and data practitioners centralize their data and information resources to create a foundation needed for their work. ScienceBase, both original software and engineered components, is released as an open source project to promote involvement from the larger scientific programming community both inside and outside the USGS. \(USGS \(2018\). _About ScienceBase._ Retrived from: [https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/about-sciencebase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/about-sciencebase)\).
