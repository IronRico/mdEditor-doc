## ScienceBase

A USGS collaborative scientific data and information management platform used directly by science teams. ScienceBase provides access to aggregated information derived from many data and information domains, including feeds from existing data systems, metadata catalogs, and scientists contributing new and original content. ScienceBase architecture is designed to help science teams and data practitioners centralize their data and information resources to create a foundation needed for their work. ScienceBase, both original software and engineered components, is released as an open source project to promote involvement from the larger scientific programming community both inside and outside the USGS. \(USGS \(2018\). _About ScienceBase._ Retrived from: [https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/about-sciencebase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/about-sciencebase)\).
