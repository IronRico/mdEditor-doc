## Auto-Save

A feature in mdEditor settings that allows information to be automatically saved as it is entered. Consult the Settings section of this manual for more information.

## Browser Cache

A temporary storage area in memory or on disk that holds the most recently downloaded Web pages.  mdEditor exploits this non-volatile memory facility of browsers to cache metadata records while they are being edited.

## Customization

The ability afforded by open-source code to edit the code of an application \(in this case mdEditor\) according to the needs of the users.

## HTML

&gt;H~~TML stands for~~ Hyper Text Markup Language, ~~. It is~~ the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML is the ‘human-readable’ and printable report of the metadata content

## ISO

International Organization for Standardization - ISO is an independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 162 [national standards bodies](https://www.iso.org/members.html).

Through its members, it brings together experts to share knowledge and develop voluntary, consensus-based, market relevant &gt;~~I~~international ~~S~~standards that support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges.

## ISO 19110

International Standards Organization Geographic Information - Feature Catalogue 19110:2005

ISO 19110 defines the methodology for cataloguing feature types. It may be used as a basis for defining the universe of discourse being modelled in a particular application, or to standardize general aspects of real world features being modelled in more than one application. \(International Organization for Standardization \(2016\). **ISO 19110:2016**. Retrieved from: [https://www.iso.org/standard/57303.html](https://www.iso.org/standard/57303.html)\)

## ISO 19115-1

Defines the schema required for describing geographic information and services by means of metadata. It provides information about the identification, the extent, the quality, the spatial and temporal aspects, the content, the spatial reference, the portrayal, distribution, and other properties of digital geographic data and services. \(International Organization for Standardization \(2014\). **ISO 19115-1:2014**. Retrieved from: [https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html)\)

## ISO 19115-2

International Standards Organization Geographic Information - Metadata 19115-2:2009

Extends the existing geographic metadata standard by defining the schema required for describing imagery and gridded data. It provides information about the properties of the measuring equipment used to acquire the data, the geometry of the measuring process employed by the equipment, and the production process used to digitize the raw data. This extension deals with metadata needed to describe the derivation of geographic information from raw data, including the properties of the measuring system, and the numerical methods and computational procedures used in the derivation. The metadata required to address coverage data in general is addressed sufficiently in the general part of ISO 19115.  \(International Organization for Standardization \(2009\). ISO 19115-2:2009.

## JSON

Javascript Object Notation, a general purpose format like CSV.

## Keywords

Words used in an information retrieval system to indicate the content of a document.

## Local Storage

&gt;~~Local Storage is t~~The user's standard storage system of directories, files, and folders.  Local Storage may be on a user's hard drive or SSD \(Solid State Device\).  In this document the term Local Storage is also meant to include any network storage accessible by the user.

## mdEditor

Web application for authoring and editing metadata, for both projects and datasets.

## mdEditor File

A mdJSON file created by mdEditor that contains all of the information contained in mdJSON, along with mdEditor settings. This can be exported and shared with collaborators, imported into another record set, or saved to a local workstation as a backup or archival copy.

## mdJSON

ADIwg standard for encoding project and data metadata, based on JavaScript Object Notation \(JSON\).

## mdJSON File

&gt;An mdJSON file that is proprietary to the Metadata toolkit developed by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group \(ADI~~WG~~wg\), learn more at \[[https://adiwg.github.io/mdTools/](https://www.gitbook.com/book/adiwg/mdeditor/edit#)\].

## mdTranslator

Open-source Ruby software application for translating between metadata standards. Metadata is input in one of the supported ‘reader’ formats and output in one of the supported ‘writer’ formats. Available as Ruby gem or Command-Line-Interface.

## Memory

&gt;~~Memory refers to tT~~he volatile high-speed RAM \(Random Access Memory\) that is the temporary working storage for all computer applications and data.  Once a unit of work is complete it must be moved to a non-volatile storage area such as browser cache or local storage to be saved for later access.  Once an application is closed its memory space is cleared to be used by other applications.

## Metadata

&gt;~~Metadata is a~~A set of data that describes and gives information about other data.

## &gt;Metadata Repositor~~ies~~y

&gt;A server where metadata is published ~~to~~.

## ParentID

Identifier for a folder on a database where records will be stored upon publishing.

## sbJSON

U.S. Geological Survey’s standard for documenting records ingested into ScienceBase Catalog. The format used to define the attributes of ScienceBase items.

## ScienceBase

A USGS collaborative scientific data and information management platform used directly by science teams. ScienceBase provides access to aggregated information derived from many data and information domains, including feeds from existing data systems, metadata catalogs, and scientists contributing new and original content. ScienceBase architecture is designed to help science teams and data practitioners centralize their data and information resources to create a foundation needed for their work. ScienceBase, both original software and engineered components, is released as an open source project to promote involvement from the larger scientific programming community both inside and outside the USGS. \(USGS \(2018\). _About ScienceBase._ Retrived from: [https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/about-sciencebase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/about-sciencebase)\).

## URI

&gt;Uniform Resource Identifier~~ is~~; a string of characters used to identify a resource. A URL is a type of URI.
