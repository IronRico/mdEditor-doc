# Resume Entering Points of Contact 
---

Now that we have created a few contacts, let's pick up where we left off while editing our first metadata record.  The first order of business will be to get mdEditor focused back on editing 'Point of Contacts' in our metadata record.

{% hint style='working' %}
  Open 'My First Metadata Record' to 'Point of Contacts'
  * Click the <strong class="btn btn-warning btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i></strong> button for 'My First Metadata Record'
  * Click 'Point Of Contact' in the 'Secondary Sidebar' 'Fast Scrolling' menu to move the panel to the top of the window
  * Click <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add</strong> button to both expand the panel and add a new 'Point Of Contact' object to the array.
{% endhint %}

Your mdEditor screen should very similar to the following:

So let's enter our 'Point Of Contact' objects.  

{% hint style='working' %}
  Add 'Point Of Contact'
  * Click in the 'Role' selector control and choose 'administrator'
  * Click in the 'Contacts' selector and choose the individual contact you created in the previous step.
{% endhint %}

A 'Point Of Contact' has been entered and the metadata record requirement has been fulfilled.  But let's add a second 'Point Of Contact' object to observe how these panel arrays work.

{% hint style='working' %}
  Add a second 'Point Of Contact'
  * Click the <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add</strong> button
   * Click in the 'Role' selector control and choose 'funder'
   * Click in the 'Contacts' selector and choose the organization contact created in the previous step 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='info' %}
  Notice the object count has increased to two in blue circle on the panel title bar reflecting the actual object count. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
  The object count can also be found in the panel's content space.  Each panel object is preceded by a number that represents its position in the array.  Note that the position number starts with zero rather than one.  It's a computer thing.   
{% endhint %}

OK, on to 'Citation' ...
