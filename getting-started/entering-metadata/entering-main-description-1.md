# Entering Descriptions 
---

The 'Description' panel, like the 'Basic Information' panel, is a collection of elements.  The only required element in the 'Description' collection is 'Abstract', so let's write or copy in our abstract.

### Abstract  <i class="fa fa-asterisk required" title="Required"></i>

Abstract is brief narrative describing the content of the main resource whether it be data, journal article, or project.

{% hint style='working' %}
  Enter an 'Abstract'
  * Type or paste your abstract into the text editor block for the 'Abstract' element
  * Experiment with the text formatting options.
{% endhint %}

As you can see, mdEditor has a pretty sweet text editor integrated into the application.  The editor supports many standard text formatting options and includes spell check, help, and full-scree modes.  It will do pretty much anything but write your abstract! Sorry.  

{% hint style='info' %}
  The text formatter used by mdEditor is called 'Markdown'.  According to Wikipedia "Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats ...", if that helps.  However if you do need help with Markdown, click the ![](/assets/bullets/question-dark.png) button on the text control button bar for an online guide.  You will likely find using the formatting button will be all you need to format your abstract, this is only a metadata record after all.
{% endhint %}

Only one more required element needed to satisfy the requirements for a minimal mdJSON metadata record.  Let's finish this thing!
