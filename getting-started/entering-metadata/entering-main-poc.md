# Entering Points Of Contact 
---

As your trained eye can now see, <span class="md-panel">Points Of Contact</span> is another array-panel containing <span class="md-panel">Point Of Contact</span> objects.  So, let's add our first Point Of Contact.

{% hint style='working' %}
  Add a Point Of Contact
  * Click the <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-plus"> </i> Add</strong> button to 'Add' a new object to the array.
{% endhint %}

<span class="md-panel">Point Of Contact</span> has two elements, <span class="md-element">Role</span> and <span class="md-element">Contacts</span>.  Both are required. 

{% hint style='info' %}
  Contacts throughout mdJSON, and therefore mdEditor, are referenced as 'responsibilities'.  A responsibility combines a role with one or more persons or organizations and a context.  In this instance the **context** is a "Point Of Contact for the resource", the **contact** is the persons or organizations to contact, and the **role** defines the boundaries of their responsibility.  Example, "contact John and Mary for information about funding".
{% endhint %}

### Role <i class="fa fa-asterisk required" title="Required"> </i>

<span class="md-element">Role</span> describes the specific area of responsibility for contact(s).  The control allows you to select from a list of predefined roles or to add a custom role of your own.  

### Contacts <i class="fa fa-asterisk required" title="Required"> </i>

<span class="md-element">Contacts</span> is a multi-select control that allows you select one or more contacts you currently have loaded in mdEditor.

But wait!  We haven't defined any contacts yet!  We can't complete the <span class="md-panel">Points Of Contact</span> requirement until we first define a contact or two.  

This is a situation you will likely encounter rather frequently while entering and editing real metadata, so we made sure you would get the chance to practice this during the exercise.  You can thank us later. 

{% hint style='working' %}
  Create a contact on the fly.
  * Save your work.  If you have AutoSave set to 'Off' click the <span class="btn btn-success btn-sm"> <i class="fa fa-floppy-o"> </i> Save</span> button in <span class="md-window">Record Management</span> block of the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.  If AutoSave is 'On', your record is already saved.
  * Click the plus sign (+) next to Contacts in the <span class="md-window">Primary Sidebar</span> to create a new contact. 
  * Continue to the next page to complete adding the new Contact record.
{% endhint %}
