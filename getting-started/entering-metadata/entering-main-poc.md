# Entering Points of Contact 
---

As your trained eye can now see, 'Points Of Contact' is another array panel containing 'Point of Contact' objects.  So, let's add our first 'Point Of Contact'.

{% hint style='working' %}
  Add a 'Point Of Contact'
  * Click the <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add</strong> button to 'Add' a new object to the array.
{% endhint %}

'Point Of Contact' has two elements, 'Role' and 'Contacts'.  Both are required. 

{% hint style='info' %}
  Contacts throughout mdJSON, and therefor mdEditor, are treated as responsible parties.  Meaning each contact is assigned to a role within the context of the metadata entry.  In words specific to this example, each contact assigned as a 'Point Of Contact' is attached to a 'Role' that describes his/her area of responsibility as a point of contact.  For instance one person or organization may be assigned to act as the point of contact for issues concerning administration ('administrator') while another is to field inquires about funding ('funder').
{% endhint %}

### Role <i class="fa fa-asterisk required" title="Required"></i>

'Role' describes the specific area of responsibility within the context of point of contact.  The control allows you to select from a list of predefined roles or to add a custom role of your own.  

### Contacts <i class="fa fa-asterisk required" title="Required"></i>

'Contacts' is a multi-select control that allows you select one or more contacts from a list of contacts you currently have loaded into browser cache. 

Wait!  We haven't defined any contacts yet.  We can't complete the 'Point Of Contact' requirement until we first defined a contact or two.  This is a situation you will likely encounter rather frequently while entering and editing real metadata, so we made sure you would get the chance to practice during this exercise.  You can thank us later. 

{% hint style='working' %}
  Create a contact on the fly.
  * Save your work.  If you have AutoSave set to 'Off' then click the <span class="btn btn-success btn-sm"> <i class="fa fa-floppy-o"></i> Save</span> button in the 'Record Management' section of the 'Secondary Sidebar'.  If AutoSave is 'On' your record is already saved.
  * Click the plus sign (+) next to 'Contacts' in the 'Primary Sidebar' to create a new contact. 
  * Continue to the next page to complete adding the new 'Contact' record.
