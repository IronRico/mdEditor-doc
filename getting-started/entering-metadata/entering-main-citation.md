# Entering Citations 
---

The 'Citation' we are entering in this step is the citation for the Main Resource.   

{% hint style='info' %}
  A full metadata record can have scores of citations in many different contexts.  Therefor, expect to see 'Citation' appear in many places throughout mdEditor.  With that in mind, the mdEditor design moved entry and editing of citations to a separate window that could be shared with all instances of citation editing.  
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='working' %}
  Position the mdEditor window to edit the 'Citation' for 'My First Metadata Record'.
{% endhint %}

The 'Citation' panel does not show any editable elements.  Instead the panel provides a view of some the more informative citation elements.  To edit the 'Citation' content we need to click the <span class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> Edit</span> button on the panel title bar or the one at the bottom of the 'Citation' panel.
