# Entering Citations 
---

The 'Citation' we are editing in this step is the citation for the principle subject of this metadata record, a.k.a. the Main Resource.   

{% hint style='info' %}
  A full metadata record can have scores of citations representing many different contexts.  Therefor, expect to see 'Citation' appear in many places throughout mdEditor.  With that in mind, the mdEditor's design moved entry and editing of citations to a separate window that could be shared with all instances of citation editing.  
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='working' %}
  Position the mdEditor window to edit the 'Citation' for 'My First Metadata Record'.
{% endhint %}

As you can see, something is different. The 'Citation' panel does not show any editable elements.  Instead the panel provides a view of some the more informative citation elements.  To edit the citation's content we just need to click the <strong class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i> Edit</strong> button on the panel title bar or the one at the bottom of the 'Citation' panel.  

{% hint style='info' %}
  'Citation' has only one required element, 'Title'.  Since the main resource citation title is used as the metadata record title and that has already been defined, technically there are no missing citation elements.  However, 'Citation' is so widely used we will jump in and edit a non-required element or two just for practice.
{% endhint %}  

{% hint style='working' %}
  Edit the Main Resource Citation
  * Click either <strong class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i> Edit</strong> button on the 'Citation' panel.
{% endhint %}

You are now looking at the 'Citation' Editing Window as shown in the image above.  Notice the 'Edit Window' title has changed from "Editing *My First Metadata Record*" to "Editing Citation"; also the path on the 'Breadcrumb Bar' confirms that you have navigated to the 'Citation' branch of the 'Main' Editing Window.  From earlier steps in this exercise you are familiar with the array control type used by the 'Alternate Titles' element, so let's just enter a few 'Alternate Titles' at this time.

{% hint style='working' %}
  Enter 'Alternate Titles'
  * Click either <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-plus"> </i> Alternate Title</strong> button
  * Enter an 'Alternate Title', I entered "First Alternate"
  * Enter a second 'Alternate Title'
  * Click the <strong class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"> </i> Back to Main</strong> button in the 'Secondary Sidebar' when you have finish entering 'Alternate Titles'.  This ends editing of the 'Citation' and, as expected, returns you to the 'Main' Editing Window.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
  There are ways other than clicking <strong class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"> </i> Back to Main</strong> to return to the 'Main' Editing Window. 
  * Click 'Main' in the 'Breadcrumb' path.
  * Click the browser's "back" button (you may also need to refresh the window before seeing your changes).
  * Click the <strong class="btn btn-warning btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i></strong> button for 'My First Metadata Record' in the 'Primary Sidebar'.
   
  All three of these methods - as well as the <strong class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"> </i> Back to Main</strong> button - will preserve your entries as you navigate away from the 'Citation' Editing Window.
{% endhint %}

So let's see what happened "back in Main"...
