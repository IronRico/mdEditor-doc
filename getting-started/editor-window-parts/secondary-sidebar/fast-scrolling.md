# Fast Scrolling
--- 

Some <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections are too long to fit on a standard monitor and require some scrolling to see all the elements of the page.  Windows can even get much longer as you continue to add your metadata.  This can make it inconvenient to locate just the information you're looking for by visually searching the record.

To assist with quickly exposing the portion of the page you need, the <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> feature was added to the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.  This facility provides links to quickly scroll the panel you need to the top of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> coupled with a visual feedback of the window's current scroll position in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.

The <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> buttons are named for the panels in the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section.  Clicking on a <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button will scroll the respective panel to the top of the window, saving you the search.  Scrolling the window manually also highlights the <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button for the <span class="md-window">Edit Window's</span> top-most panel providing visual confirmation of the window's scroll position. 

{% hint style='tip' %}
  Browser scrolling behavior generally presents a full page whenever possible.  Therefore, when a <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button toward the bottom of the list is clicked (e.g. 'Graphic Overview' in the above image), that panel will scroll to the top of the page only when there is enough information below the panel to fill the remainder of the page.  In these cases the desired panel may not be quite at the top, but it will be on the page.  This behavion may vary by browser.

  * Scroll the window and watch the highlighting of the <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> buttons change.  Observe the pairing of the highlighted <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button and the <span class="md-window">Edit Window's</span> top panel.
  * Click on a few of the <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> buttons and observe page scrolling.

{% hint style='info' %}
  Each <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section will have a unique <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> section that matches up with the panels for that <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section.  Some <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections have only a few or even no panels, so not all <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections will have a <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> feature in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.
