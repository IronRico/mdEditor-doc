# Closing Thoughts

Congratulations!  Unless you just skipped directly to this page you have now completed the "Getting Started" guided tour of mdEditor.  Admittedly, here are still many details yet to cover, mdEditor is a very rich metadata editor.  The reference pages which follow attempt to cover this full set of features.  So don't close the book just yet.  Keep a link to this document handy for when you find you need to add a map, a dictionary, or other advanced feature not explored in the "Getting Started" tutorial.
