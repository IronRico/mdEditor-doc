# Importing a Metadata Record
---

Since we just exported our metadata records to local storage it stands to reason we should also be able to import metadata records into the mdEditor's browser cache. And we can.  

Exporting our metadata records to local storage did not clear them out of browser cache, there are still there.  To have import be a meaningful exercise we will need to clear the browser cache first. 

{% hint style='danger' %}
  Although this is just an exercise built upon meaningless metadata, it is good practice to be sure you have exported all the data you wish to keep and that you know where it is before clearing browser cache.  Have you?  And can you find it?
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='working' %}
  Open the <span class="md-window">Settings Window</span>.
  * Click the <i class="fa fa-cog"> </i> 'Settings' button in the <span class="md-window">Primary Navigation Bar</span>.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='working' %}
  Clear browser cache.
  * Click the <span class="btn btn-danger btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-times"> </i> Clear Storage Cache</span> button.
  * Confirm the delete of ALL records.
{% endhint %}

mdEditor will reset and when it returns there will be no 'Metadata Records', 'Contacts', or 'Dictionaries' found in browser cache or indexed in the <span class="md-window">Primary Sidebar</span>.  Browser cache is empty.

{% hint style='info' %}
  Browser cache can also be emptied by functions build into every browser.  Where that function is found is browser dependent.  It is generally grouped with other tools such as 'Clear browser history'.  Make a practice of saving your metadata records to local storage regularly to avoid unintended loss.

With browser cache now empty, let's reload our saved metadata records.
