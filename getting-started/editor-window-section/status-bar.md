# Status Bar

The Status Bar is always present at the bottom of the mdEditor window.  There are only a few items on the Status Bar at present which are discussed below.

### Issue Reporting and Tracking <span class="btn btn-warning btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Report Issue</span> 

Issue you encounter while using mdEditor can be reported and tracked using the 'Report Issue' button.  This will open to a page of known mdEditor issues and provide a means of posting to an existing issue or creating a new issue if warranted. 

### AutoSave Status

No surprise, the AutoSave status reports the status of the AutoSave option and will either be 'On' or 'Off'.
