# Entering Metadata
---

We have come to the point in our "Getting Started" exercise where we begin entering metadata.  To keep this exercise brief and meaningful, we are choosing to enter only the minimal metadata required to create a valid record.  But what do we mean by 'minimal'?  In this context minimal refers to entering the fewest elements possible to satisfy the mdJSON standard.  Admittedly this will not constitute a very 'healthy' metadata record, but it will give us a basic record.  

{% hint style='info' %}
  Keep in mind that each established standard format, such as ISO or FGDC, will have its own definition for what constitutes a minimal metadata record, and this is very likely to be more comprehensive than mdJSON's definition.  Not to worry, mdJSON has the elements you will need to support the other standards; we just need to return to editing our record and add that standard's specific required elements.  We will see how this works later in the exercise.

  For now, return to the 'Main' section of the Editing Window if you are not there already.
