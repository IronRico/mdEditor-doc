# Metadata Editing Window
---

And finally, the big kahuna, the *Edit Window*!  The Edit Window is where all metadata entry and editing takes place.  While the buttons and controls described to this point  deal primarily with records, the Edit Window gets down to working with individual data elements.  

Let's begin by describing the plethora of buttons and informational icons on the Edit Window.  I have collapsed all the panels on the Edit Window to make these a bit more visible - at least the ones that appear on panel headers.

Notice that in general informational icons appear on the left of the Editing Window and follow the name of the Edit Panel.  Buttons appear on the right side of the Edit Panel.  Both the icons and buttons pertain only to the contents of their respective panel.  

Let's divide the introduction of these icons and buttons up and discuss them on the next few pages.
