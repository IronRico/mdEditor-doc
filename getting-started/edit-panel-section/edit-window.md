# Metadata Editing Window
---

And finally, the big kahuna, the *Edit Window*!  The Edit Window is where all metadata entry and editing takes place.  While the buttons and controls described to this point  deal primarily with records, the Edit Window gets down to working with individual data elements.  

Let's begin by describing the plethora of buttons and informational icons on the Edit Window.  I have collapsed all the panels on the Edit Window to make these a bit more visible - at least the ones that appear on panel headers.

The first thing to note is that in general informational icons appear on the left of the Editing Window following the name of the Edit Panel.  Buttons appear on the right side of the Edit Panel.  Both pertain to the contents of their respective panel only.  

Let's divide the work up and discuss informational icons and buttons separately on the next few pages.
