# Fast Scrolling
--- 

Some Edit Windows are too long to fit on standard monitors and require scrolling to see all your entries.  These windows can even get much longer as you add arrays of contacts or dates.  This can make it frustrating to locate just the information you're looking for by visually searching the record.

To assist with quickly exposing the section of the page you need the Fast Scrolling section was added to the Secondary Sidebar.  This facility provides quick links to Edit Window panels coupled with a visual feedback of the window's current scroll position.

The buttons in the Fast Scrolling section of the Secondary Sidebar are given the names of the panels in the Edit Window.  Clicking on a Fast Scroll button will move the respective panel to the top of the window giving you immediate access.  Scrolling the window manually will highlight the Fast Scroll button for the Edit Window's top-most panel visually identifying the window's scroll state.

  Browser scrolling behavior always presents a full page if possible.  Therefore, when a Fast Scroll button near the end of the list is clicked (e.g. 'Graphic Overview' in the above image) the panel will scroll to the top of the page only if there is enough information below the panel to fill the remainder of the page.

  * Scroll the window and watch the highlighting of the Fast Scroll buttons change.  Observe the matching of highlighted button highlight and panel name.
  * Click on a few of the Fast Scroll buttons and observe page scrolling.

  Each Edit Window section will have a unique Fast Scrolling section that matches the panels for that Edit Window section.  Some Edit Window sections are relatively short or do not have panels, so not all Edit Window sections have a Fast Scrolling section in the Secondary Sidebar.
