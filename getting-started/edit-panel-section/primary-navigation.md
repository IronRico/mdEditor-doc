The Primary Navigation Bar displays buttons that navigate you away from the Edit View (or whichever view you happen to be on at the time) to other facilities within mdEditor. These buttons are located in top-most navigation bar which has been outlined by the yellow rectangle below.

### <i class="fa fa-tachometer"></i> Dashboard
The Dashboard View is the initial view when starting mdEditor.  It displays relevant notes about mdEditor's status and a few statistics for the metadata records you currently have loaded in browser cache.  

### <i class="fa fa-sign-out"></i>Export 
The Export facility helps you move the metadata records you have been editing from browser cache to your local and networked storage devices for long-term backup and storage.

### <i class="fa fa-sign-in"></i> Import 
The Import facility helps you load metadata records from your local and networked storage into browser cache for editing with mdEditor.

### <i class="fa fa-share-square-o"></i> Publish
The Publish facility can transmit your metadata record directly to a supported metadata repository handling most or all interface actions for you.  

### <i class="fa fa-retweet"></i> Translate
The Translate facility interfaces with the publicly hosted mdTranslator.  It will send the selected metadata record to the translator, request translation into the metadata format of your choice, and capture the output for you to be viewed and saved to your local storage. 

### Profile
Profile is the exception, it does not navigate away from the Edit View. Profile instead modifies the behavior of the Editing Window by setting which panels and elements are displayed and whether or not they are required.  

{% hint style='tip' %}
  Custom profiles can be written to meet the requirements of an organization or the specifications of a particular resource type.
{% endhint %}


### <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> Settings 
The settings button will take you to the Settings View which hold options that modify the default behavior of mdEditor.
