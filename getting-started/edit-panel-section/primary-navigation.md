The Primary Navigation Bar displays buttons that will navigate you away from the Editing Panel (or whichever panel you happen to be on at the time) to other facilities of mdEditor. These buttons are located in top-most navigation bar which has been outlined by the yellow rectangle below.

### Dashboard
The Dashboard Panel is the home panel of mdEditor.  It was the first panel you saw when you started up the editor.  It displays a note about mdEditor and a few statistics for the records currently loaded into the browser cache.  

### Export & Import
The Export and Import facilities help you manage moving metadata records between browser cache and your local storage.

### Publish
The Publish facility can transmit your metadata record directly to a supported metadata repository handling all interface actions for you.  

### Translate
The Translate facility interfaces with the mdTranslator.  It will send your mdEditor metadata record to mdTranslator, request translation to the metadata format of your choice, and capture the output for you to save to your local storage. 

### Profile
Profile is the exception, it does not navigate away from the Editing Panel.  Instead Profile modifies the behavior of the Editing Panel by setting which panel elements are displayed and whether or not they are required.  Custom profiles can be written to meet the requirements of an organization or the specifications of a particular resource type.

### Settings <i class="fa fa-cog"></i>
The settings button will take you to the Settings Panel which hold options that can modify the default behavior of mdEditor.
