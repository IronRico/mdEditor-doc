# Editing Window Icons

### <i class="fa fa-asterisk required"></i> Panel has Required Elements

The big red asterisk after a panel name means that one or more or its elements are required to meet the standard for a minimal, valid metadata record - or contact or dictionary depending on which record type is being edited.  

{% hint style='info' %}
  The red asterisk is also used at the element level to identify which panel elements are required.  
{% endhint %}

  Many Edit Window panels allow multiple instances of a panel's data type such as multiple 'Points of Contact' or multiple 'Graphic Overviews'.  These array panels are easily identified by two characteristics; they each have an 'Add' button on the right side of the panel title bar to insert a new item, and a number inscribed by in colored circle immediately after the panel name. This number is the number of items found for the panel type, and the color of the circle indicates how requirements have been satisfied.  The next three icons explain.
