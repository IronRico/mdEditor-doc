### Show/Hide
Toward the top of the Primary Sidebar is the mdEditor logo.  Clicking on the logo will hide or show the Primary Sidebar according to its current state.  This may be helpful to gain more screen real estate while working from smaller devices.

### <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Context Sensitive Help
Clicking on the question mark icon will display help appropriate to the current page.  The help window will also provide a link back to the corresponding page in this document. 

### Object Overview
Clicking on the object name, in this case a record, will change to an overview of the object's data.  Data cannot be edited from this read-only view.  

{% hint style='info' %}
  In the above image the record name and icon are colored orange because the record contains schema errors.  This is to be expected since we just created the record.  In this case the record is missing a point-of-contact, citation, and other required elements.  To enter this missing information we use the edit mode as described in the next paragraph.
{% endhint %}


### <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Edit Object
Click on the pencil icon next to any object name to edit the object.  The color of the text and icon indicate its current status. 

{% hint style='info' %}
  * Green indicates the record is saved and contains no schema errors.
  * Orange indicates the record contains some schema errors.  
  * Red indicates the record's data has not been saved.
{% endhint %} 

{% hint style='tip' %}
  When 'AutoSave' is turned on you will not see objects in red since all entries are automatically saved
{% endhint %}
  
### <i class="fa fa-list"></i> Open Dashboard
Click the list icon to display a list of all objects of the associated type.  This dashboard will provide you the ability to apply certain actions such as show, edit, delete, and preview to any of the listed options.  

{% hint style='tip' %}
  The dashboard can be particularly helpful when you have more objects than can be displayed in the Primary Sidebar or when you want to apply an action to more than one object at a time.
{% endhint %}

### <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add New Object>
Click the plus icon to create a new object of the associated type.

### <strong class="fa fa-angle-up"></strong> Expand & Collapse List
Click an up arrow icon <strong class="fa fa-angle-up"></strong> to collapse an open object list.  Or click the down arrow icon <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i> on a collapsed list to reveal its contents.
