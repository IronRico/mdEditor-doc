# Navigating the Edit View
---
Your newly created metadata record should appear very similar to the following screen image; without all the text balloons of course...

Since there are quite a few buttons and icons in mdEditor to help make the metadata editing process as quick and clean as possible, let's divide the window up into parts and take a look at each of these separately.  

{% hint style='tip' %}
  Throughout the remainder of this documentation the following notations will be used ...
  * Window parts will be formatted as <span class="md-window">Window Part</span>
  * <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections will be formatted as <span class="md-section">Section Name</span>
  * <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> panels will be formatted as <span class="md-panel">Panel Name</span>
  * <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> panel elements will be formatted as <span class="md-element">Element Name</span>
{% endhint %}
