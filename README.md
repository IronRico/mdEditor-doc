# mdEditor User Manual

## Overview

The mdEditor is a web application that allows users to author and edit metadata for projects, datasets, maps, images, and documents. The primary design goal was to develop an application that would allow someone to create and use archival quality metadata without the need for an extensive knowledge of metadata standards.

## Features

* Responsive, two-panel layout should allow display on desktop and mobile devices.
* Launched through a web browser, no need to install software.
* Metadata is initially stored in the browser local storage cache.
* Metadata can be exported as a text file \(JSON format\) for archiving or sharing.
* Open source development allows for customization.
* Defined schema \(mdJSON schema\) allows for validating records.
* Can be used in conjunction with an associated [mdTranslator](https://github.com/adiwg/mdTranslator) application to create ISO and FGDC compliant metadata records.

## General Functionality

### How mdEditor stores information

* mdEditor stores information on your local computer in your local browser cache. Itâ€™s a local storage cache, not your normal file cache. Clearing your browser cache will not clear your mdEditor records.
* In mdEditor settings, you can clear storage cache, but this removes your information/entries.

### Opening mdEditor

* mdEditor is currently hosted on the GitHub website and can be opened by following this URL: [https://jlblcc.github.io/mdEditor/\#/dashboard](https://jlblcc.github.io/mdEditor/#/dashboard)
* Currently, when you open mdEditor, you will see an Update Alert that the application is under development. This is normal and will remain as such until the production version is ready.
* Chrome is the recommended web browser for using mdEditor. The editor should work in other browsers, but has been fully tested in Chrome.

## Background

The mdEditor is an extension of a project initiated by the [Alaska Data Integration Working Group](http://www.adiwg.org/about/) \(ADIwg\) to adopt a set of project-level metadata fields for use by [member organizations](http://www.adiwg.org/about/#contributing-organizations). This editor is one of several integrated ADIwg projects, which include an ADIwg developed [mdJSON Schema](https://github.com/adiwg/mdJson-schemas) that forms the underlying data structure for metadata records and a [variety of tools](http://mdtools.adiwg.org/#popup-welcome) that allow the mdJSON data file to be validated against the mdJSON schema and converted to other formats.

Primary development has been performed by Josh Bradley \(joshua\_bradley@fws.gov\) and Stan Smith \(ssmith@arcticlcc.org\) of the [Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative](http://arcticlcc.org/).
