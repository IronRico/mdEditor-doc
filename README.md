# mdEditor User Manual

## Overview

The mdEditor is a web application that allows users to author and edit metadata for projects, datasets, maps, images, and documents. The primary design goal was to develop an application that would allow someone to create and use archival quality metadata without the need for an extensive knowledge of metadata standards.

## Features

* Responsive, two-panel layout should allow display on desktop and mobile devices.
* Launched through a web browser, no need to install software.
* Metadata is initially stored in the browser local storage cache.
* Metadata can be exported as a text file \(JSON format\) for archiving or sharing.
* Open source development allows for customization.
* Defined schema \(mdJSON schema\) allows for validating records.
* Can be used in conjunction with an associated [mdTranslator](https://github.com/adiwg/mdTranslator) application to create ISO and FGDC compliant metadata records.
