The export function will allow the contents of the current metadata recordset to be saved as a [mdJSON file](https://github.com/adiwg/mdJson-schemas/blob/master/test/draft-04.json). The mdJSON file can be shared with collaborators and imported into another record set, or saved to a local workstation as a backup or archival copy.

Users can export a singular record/contact or groups of records/contacts by individually selecting the items to be exported, and then clicking **Export Selected**. This will export the selected items as **mdEditor **files. Users can also use the **Export mdJSON **button to export selected items as **mdJSON **files. Clicking the **Include Settings **switch will also export mdEditor settings. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn about settings.

> **Best Practice**: For a complete backup, use the **Export All **button. This exports an mdEditor file containing all records and contacts.
