# Export \(![](/assets/symbol_sign-out_16.png)\)

The export function will allow the contents of the current metadata recordset to be saved as a [mdJSON file](https://github.com/adiwg/mdJson-schemas/blob/master/test/draft-04.json). The mdJSON file can be shared with collaborators and imported into another recordset, or saved to a local workstation as a backup or archival copy.
