# Export \(![](/assets/symbol_sign-out_16.png)\)

The export function will allow the contents of the current metadata recordset to be saved as a mdEditor or a mdJSON file. The files can then be shared with collaborators and imported into another record set, into another browser using mdEditor, or saved to a local workstation as a backup or archival copy.

> ![](/assets/NoteSmall.png) mdJSON files can be uploaded and translated to other formats via the mdTranslator application while mdEditor files are exclusive to the mdEditor application an retain all mdEditor information, including settings.

> ![](/assets/BestPracticeSmall.png)**Best Practice**: For a complete backup, use the **Export All **button. This exports an mdEditor file containing all records and contacts.

**Export Options**

* **Export All:** will export everything currently loaded in mdEditor into a single file. Exports an mdEditor JSON file.

* **Export Selected:** will only export the items you have selected \(so an individual record or contacts, etc.\). If nothing is selected it will be disabled \(i.e., grayed out\). Exports an mdEditor JSON file.

* **Export mdJSON: ** only works for metadata records \(i.e., doesn't work for contacts\). Exports just the mdJSON file, which is a standalone JSON file you can load into mdTranslator and have it translate into other metadata formats. mdJSON files imported into mdEditor are treated as new records and will not merge/update an existing record.

* Clicking the **Include Settings **switch will also export mdEditor settings. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn about settings.

> ![](/assets/NoteSmall.png)If you need to switch browsers for mdEditor, or want to send your setting to someone else, you can export them.
