# Contacts

Contacts are individuals or organizations that can be referenced by other contacts, projects, or products. Contacts contain information such as name of individuals or organization, email address, physical address, website, and phone number so that viewers of metadata can communicate with those affiliated with a metadata record.

### General notes on Contacts

Copying contacts will change the ID and the name \(the name will be “Copy of ….”\) but all the other information will be the same.

> **Best practice**: It is safest to export all contacts whenever you export a project/product. Consult the [Export](/export.md) section of this manual to learn more.
