# Contacts

Contacts are individuals or organizations that can be referenced by other contacts, projects, or products. Contacts contain information such as: email address; physical address; website; phone number; etc. Contacts allow viewers of metadata records the ability to contact creators or curators of said metadata.

### General notes on Contacts

Copying contacts will change the ID and the name \(the name will be “Copy of ….”\) but all the other information will be the same.

> **Best practice**: It is safest to export all contacts whenever you export a project/product. Consult the [Export](/export.md) section of this manual to learn more.
