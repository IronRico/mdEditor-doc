# Requirements for Publishing

Publishing requires the record to be a "valid" record meaning mdEditor is enforcing the minimum fields required in a record for creation of an mdJSON file.

Publishing requires that you have a parent identifier assigned to every record. The Default Parent Identifier can be set in mdEditor Settings. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) for more information.
