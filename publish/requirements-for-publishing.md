# Requirements for Publishing

Publishing requires the record to be a "valid" record meaning mdEditor is enforcing the minimum fields required in a record for creation of an mdJSON file.

Publishing requires that you have a** Parent Identifier** assigned to every record. A parent identifier \(or Parent ID\) notes a folder on a database where the records will be stored upon publishing**.** The Default Parent Identifier can be set in mdEditor Settings. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual for more information.
