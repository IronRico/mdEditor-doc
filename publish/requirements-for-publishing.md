# Requirements for Publishing

Publishing requires the record to be a "valid" record \(i.e., passes the basic mdEditor validation\)

Publishing requires that you have a** Parent Identifier** assigned to every record. A parent identifier \(or Parent ID\) notes a folder on a database where the records will be stored upon publishing**.** The Default Parent Identifier can be set in mdEditor Settings. Consult [Settings](/settings.md) for more information.
