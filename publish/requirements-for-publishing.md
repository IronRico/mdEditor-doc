# Requirements for Publishing

Publishing requires the record to be a "valid" record \(i.e., passes the basic mdEditor validation\)

Publishing requires that you have a parent identifier assigned to every record. The Default Parent Identifier can be set in mdEditor Settings. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) for more information.

> Note: Please use a testing folder before you update your real records.
