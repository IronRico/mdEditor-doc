# FAQ

1. Is moving the record in the mdEditor outline also moving the record in ScienceBase, or just overwriting the existing record?

   > If you have a record in SB already, then it is not advisable to move items in the publishing outline structure.
   >
   > If you want to move the item on ScienceBase via mdEditor, then edit the parent identifier in the record located in Metadata-&gt;Parent Metadata-&gt;Identifier.

2. If I have a project on ScienceBase already, one or more intermediate organizing folders, and then have a product, will the product record go back to the same place?
   > It will go back to the exact same place as long as you don't change the parent ID in the metadata record itself or drag it around in the publishing outline.
