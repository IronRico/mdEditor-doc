# FAQ

1. Is this moving the record in ScienceBase or just overwriting the existing record?
   > If you have a record in SB already, then don't mess with the outline structure.

   > If you want to move the item on ScienceBase via mdEditor, then edit the parent identifier in the record located in Metadata-&gt;Parent Metadata-&gt;Identifier.
2. If I have a project on ScienceBase already and one or more intermediate organizing folders and then have a product, will the product record go back to the same place?
   > It will go back to the exact same place as long as you don't change the parent ID in the metadata record itself or drag it around in the publishing outline.
