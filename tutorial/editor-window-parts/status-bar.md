# Status Bar

The <span class="md-window">Status Bar</span> is always present at the bottom of the mdEditor window.  There are only a few items on the <span class="md-window">Status Bar</span> at present which are discussed below.

### <span class="btn btn-warning btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-github"> </i> Report Issue</span> Issue Reporting and Tracking 

An issue you encounter while using mdEditor can be reported and tracked using the 'Report Issue' button.  This will open to a page of known mdEditor issues and provide a means of posting to an existing issue or creating a new issue if warranted. 

### AutoSave Status

No surprise, the 'AutoSave' status reports the status of the 'AutoSave' option and will either be 'On' or 'Off'.
