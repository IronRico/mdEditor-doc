### Auto Save

The Auto Save option will write all changes to local storage when you exit a data entry field. Changes must be manually saved if the Auto Save feature is turned off. A record that has been modified will be flagged with a red edit icon \(![](/assets/record_modified.png)\). A record that has been saved will be identified by a green edit icon \(![](/assets/record_saved.png)\). An incomplete record will not turn green when saved.

### Clear All Records

All records can be cleared by clicking the **Clear Storage Cache**.  
**\*Caution! Clearing all records will delete your current set of records. If you wish to retain your records for future use, be sure and make a backup with the **[**export**](/export.md)** function before clearing the cache.  **
