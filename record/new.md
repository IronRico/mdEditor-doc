Both fields are required to create a new record. Once the title and type have been entered, you must confirm the creation of the new record by selecting "Save".

Once "Save" has been selected, the record will be stored as part of the metadata record set and it will be [opened for editing](/record\edit.md) in the main editor region. See: [Record Edit](/record\edit.md).
