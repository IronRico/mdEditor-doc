# Record Extent

**Record Extent** refers to geographic bounds for the project.

Clicking the **Edit Extent Features** button allows for the addition of **Feature Properties **such as: **ID**; **Name**; or **Description**. Users can draw polygon or a bounding box in the initial window.

Features can also be imported using the **Import Features **button. Features such as geoJSON, shapefiles, and kml can be imported. However, file attributes \(such as name and description\), will not be imported.

> ![](/assets/BestPracticeSmall.png)**Best Practice**: Shapefiles are limited to 5000 vertices. It is recommend that you create only simple polygons or bounding boxes. If you want greater detail, attach high-definition shapefiles instead of trying to draw them.
