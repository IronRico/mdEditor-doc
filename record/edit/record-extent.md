**Record Extent** refers to geographic bounds for the project. 

**\*Note: **The extent must be geographic coordinates, not projected coordinates!	

Users can draw polygon or a bounding box in the initial window.

Clicking the **Edit Extent Features** button allows for the addition of **Feature Properties **such as: **ID**; **Name**; or **Description**.  

Features can also be imported using the **Import Features **button. Features such as geoJSON, shapefiles, and kml can be imported. However file attributes \(such as name and description\) will not be imported.
