# Edit Distributors

\(Screenshot of "Transfer Options" window\)

Transfer Options:

* Contacts
* Role

* Transfer Size: Describe size of resource in MB.

* Distribution Units: Don’t worry about this. Used for items with unique units \(e.g. USGS quads\).

Consult the [**Online Options**](/record/edit/quality/edit-distributors/online-option.md) section of this manual to learn how to add online options.



●    Most likely will just be adding distributer information and URL \(e.g., if The Nature Conservancy is hosting a data source, the distributor is The Nature Conservancy and then enter link to location of distribution\).
