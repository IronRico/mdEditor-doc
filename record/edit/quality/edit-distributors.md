# Edit Distributors

●    Transfer Options:

○    Transfer Size: Describe size of resource in MB.

○    Distribution Units: Don’t worry about this. Used for items with unique units \(e.g. USGS quads\).

○    Offline options: Add contact information for obtaining product.

○    Online options: Add url here and type of url space. If it’s a direct download, select “download.” If it goes to an informational page, select “information.”

●    Most likely will just be adding distributer information and URL \(e.g., if The Nature Conservancy is hosting a data source, the distributor is The Nature Conservancy and then enter link to location of distribution\).
