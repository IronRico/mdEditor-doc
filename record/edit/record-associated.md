○	Associate project with product.  For product, select “parentProject.”

○	“Initiative type” is not required - for us, it would almost always be project.

○	Select “resource type.”

○	Add identifier. 

○	Can make an association in either direction and it takes care of the association for ScienceBase. But if you have just a one-way association in other metadata formats, won’t show up both ways. Ideal to have the associations go both ways because projects and all of their products may not be loaded into mdEditor at the same time. Josh can look into injecting references the opposite way upon export, but both would have to be loaded into mdEditor upon export.

○	Ideally, you should manage/create/edit project and product records together as a set.
