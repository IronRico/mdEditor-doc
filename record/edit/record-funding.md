Consult the [**Allocation**](/record/edit/record-funding/allocation.md) section of this manual to learn how to add allocations.

**Time Period **will generally be start date only, end date only, or both.  If you put in start and end date, it will calculate fiscal year off the end date. Enter as much information as you can.  

**Start and End date** refers to when the money was allocated and distributed.
