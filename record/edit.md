Click the **Edit **button to begin editing your record.

### Navigation When Editing Records

You can use your browser’s forward and back arrows to navigate between record tabs, just like you would on a web page.

When editing a Metadata record, navigation **breadcrumbs** appear in light blue on top of the form.

The **sub-menu navigation bar** is located below the breadcrumbs.  These change depending on what function is in use.

If hover over links there will be a short description of what that section is.

The** Spotlight Tool** is a blue box with a white circle inside at right of the section name.  It grays everything out except the panel you’re working on to help focus on that particular section.

### Required Fields

Certain fields are required in order to meet ISO metadata requirements. Required fields are noted by the following.

A red asterisk means that this is required.

A red number in a circle is also noting that this is a required field.

**Not required **will be a 0 with an orange background.

Once you’ve entered information in a required field, the circle will turn blue and include a number.
