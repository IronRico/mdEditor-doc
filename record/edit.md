### Navigation When Editing Records

The **sub-menu navigation bar** is located below the breadcrumbs.  These change depending on what function is in use.

If hover over links there will be a short description of what that section is.

The** Spotlight Tool** is a blue box with white circle inside at right of section name.  It grays everything out except the panel you’re working on to help focus on that particular section.

Red number in circle is also noting that this is a required field.
