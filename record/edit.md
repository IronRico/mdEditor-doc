### Navigation When Editing Records

* When editing a Metadata record, navigation **breadcrumbs** appear in light blue on top of the form.
* The **sub-menu navigation bar** is located below the breadcrumbs.  These change depending on what function is in use.
* If you hover over links there will be a short description of what that section is.
* The** Spotlight Tool** is a blue box with a white circle inside at right of the section name.  It grays everything out except the panel you’re working on to help focus on that particular section
