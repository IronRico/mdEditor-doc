### Navigation When Editing Records

When editing a Metadata record, navigation **breadcrumbs** appear in light blue on top of the form. These can be used to navigate.

The **sub-menu navigation bar** is located below the breadcrumbs.  These change depending on what function is in use.

* If you hover over the items, there will be a short description of what each section is.

The** Spotlight Tool** is a blue box with a white circle at the right of each section.  It grays everything out except the panel you’re working on to help focus on that particular section

### **Required Fields**

Certain fields are required in order to meet ISO metadata requirements. Required fields are noted by the following.

![](/assets/red_number.png)A red number in a circle is also noting that this is a required field.

![](/assets/orange_ast.png)A number with an orange background is noting that a field is not required

![](/assets/blue_number.png)A blue circle with a number means that a field has been filled out.

Editing options include:

* **Save**: Used to save changes. 
  > ![](/assets/note_small.png) Save can only be used if auto-save is turned off and a change has been made. Consult the [**Settings**](/settings.md)** **section of this manual for more information.
* **Cancel**: Used to undo changes that have not yet been saved.

* **Copy**: The copy button makes a duplicate of a record.

  > ![](/assets/note_small.png) Making a copy will generate a new ID for the copied record and be named “Copy of …”. All the other info will remain the same including associations. The “metadata identifier” is NOT copied but any identifiers in the main citation WILL be copied.

* **Delete**: The delete button will completely delete the record.

  > ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice**: Make a backup of your record before deleting. Consult the [**Export**](/export.md)** **section of this manual to learn how to make a backup.
