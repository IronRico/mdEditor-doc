# Publish

\(screenshot of the "Publish" button\)

Users can publish records to an online platform. The current option is ScienceBase.

* Enter your ScienceBase **Username** and **Password **and click **Login**.
* Select the records that you would like to publish and click **Publish**.

**Publish** is only visible when youâ€™re viewing a metadata record.

Upon successfully publishing to ScienceBase, the third column will display a date and time. The record's ScienceBase ID will be displayed in the first column, and the Parent ID will be displayed in the second column. Consult the [Parent Metadata](/record/edit/metadata/parent-metadata.md) section of this manual to learn how to add a Parent ID.

If there are any errors during publishing, they will be noted in the third column.
