# Copying Records

The **Copy** button is located in right vertical menu. It makes a duplicate of metadata record. Consult the [**Getting Started**](/getting-started.md) section of this manual for more information on the **Vertical Menu**.

Use the Copy button carefully:

* It will generate a new UUID for the copied record and be named “Copy of …”. All the other info will be the same, including the associations. The “metadata identifier” is NOT copied but any identifiers in the main citation WILL be copied, including any SBIDs \(SBIDs can be placed in either Metadata/Metadata Identifier or Main/Citation/Identifier, with best practice being to put in metadata identifier\).

○    Make sure you review all of the copied information before saving.

○    Pros:

■    can use to start product metadata record

■    can use to populate multiple products \(e.g., multiple workshop reports, poster based on a publication, etc.\)

■    can create template record for your LCC or for a project that can be used as a starting place for each full metadata record

○    Cons:  need carefully review all info in copied record to ensure all copied info is still relevant to the copied record, particularly any identifiers
