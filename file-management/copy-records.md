### General Notes On Copying Records

> ![](/assets/note_small.png)Use the Copy button carefully:

Making a copy will generate a new ID for the copied record and will be named “Copy of …”. All other information will remain the same including associations. The “metadata identifier” is NOT copied but any identifiers in the main citation WILL be copied.

**Making a copy of a record can be used to: **

* Start a new product metadata record
* Populate multiple products faster \(e.g., multiple workshop reports, a poster based on a publication\)

* Create a 'template record' for a project that can be used as a starting place for each full metadata record

> ![](/assets/note_small.png)Before saving, carefully review all information in your copied record to ensure that all 'copied information' is still relevant to the record, particularly any identifiers.
