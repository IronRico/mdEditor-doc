## How mdEditor Stores Information

mdEditor stores information on your local computer in your local browser cache. Itâ€™s a local storage cache, not your normal file cache. Clearing your browser cache will not clear your mdEditor records.

> **Note**: In mdEditor settings, you can clear storage cache. This removes your information/entries. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn more. \*It is very important that you back up your records before clearing the mdEditor cache in order to prevent a loss of data. Consult the [Export](/export.md) section of this manual to learn more.
