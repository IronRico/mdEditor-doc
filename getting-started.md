## Getting Started

### How mdEditor stores information

* mdEditor stores information on your local computer in your local browser cache. Itâ€™s a local storage cache, not your normal file cache. Clearing your browser cache will not clear your mdEditor records.
  > **Note**: In mdEditor settings, you can clear storage cache, but this removes your information/entries.

### Opening mdEditor

* mdEditor is currently hosted on the GitHub website and can be opened by following this URL: [https://jlblcc.github.io/mdEditor/\#/dashboard](https://jlblcc.github.io/mdEditor/#/dashboard)
* Currently, when you open mdEditor, you will see an Update Alert that the application is under development. This is normal and will remain as such until the production version is ready.
* Chrome is the recommended web browser for using mdEditor. The editor should work in other browsers, but has been fully tested in Chrome.
