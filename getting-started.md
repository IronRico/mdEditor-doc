## Getting Started

### How mdEditor stores information

* mdEditor stores information on your local computer in your local browser cache. Itâ€™s a local storage cache, not your normal file cache. Clearing your browser cache will not clear your mdEditor records.
* In mdEditor settings, you can clear storage cache, but this removes your information/entries.

### Opening mdEditor

* mdEditor is currently hosted on the GitHub website and can be opened by following this URL: [https://jlblcc.github.io/mdEditor/\#/dashboard](https://jlblcc.github.io/mdEditor/#/dashboard)
* Currently, when you open mdEditor, you will see an Update Alert that the application is under development. This is normal and will remain as such until the production version is ready.
* Chrome is the recommended web browser for using mdEditor. The editor should work in other browsers, but has been fully tested in Chrome.

## Background

The mdEditor is an extension of a project initiated by the [Alaska Data Integration Working Group](http://www.adiwg.org/about/) \(ADIwg\) to adopt a set of project-level metadata fields for use by [member organizations](http://www.adiwg.org/about/#contributing-organizations). This editor is one of several integrated ADIwg projects, which include an ADIwg developed [mdJSON Schema](https://github.com/adiwg/mdJson-schemas) that forms the underlying data structure for metadata records and a [variety of tools](http://mdtools.adiwg.org/#popup-welcome) that allow the mdJSON data file to be validated against the mdJSON schema and converted to other formats.

Primary development has been performed by Josh Bradley \(joshua\_bradley@fws.gov\) and Stan Smith \(ssmith@arcticlcc.org\) of the [Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative](http://arcticlcc.org/).
