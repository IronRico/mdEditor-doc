# Dashboard

## Overview

The mdEditor application is designed using a two-pane layout. The left _**sidebar**_ \(1\) provides the primary navigation showing a list of metadata records, contacts and data dictionaries. The right pane displays a context-sensitive _**main menu**_ at the top \(2\) and a primary _**editor region**_ below \(3\) that displays and allows for the editing of a selected object.![](/assets/mdEditor_areas.png)
