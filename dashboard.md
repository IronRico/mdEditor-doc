# Dashboard

The mdEditor application is designed using a two-pane layout. The left pane \[Is there an official name: navigation pane?\] provides the primary navigation showing a list of metadata records, contacts and data dictionaries. The right pane \[context sensitive dashboard?\] is the primary editor region displaying details about the record, contact or dictionary that is selected on the left pane.

The dashboard menu provides options to import and export records and to configure user options.
