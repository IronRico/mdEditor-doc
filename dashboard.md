# Dashboard

## Overview

The mdEditor application is designed using a two-pane layout. The left [_**sidebar**_](#sidebar) \(1\) provides the primary navigation showing a list of [metadata records](/records.md), [contacts](/contacts.md) and [data dictionaries](/dictionaries.md). The right pane displays a context-sensitive [_**main menu**_](#main-menu) at the top \(2\) and a primary [_**editor region**_](#editor-region) below \(3\) that displays and allows for the editing of a selected object.![](/assets/mdEditor_areas.png)
