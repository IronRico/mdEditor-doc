# Right Vertical Menu

The right vertical menu allows for general manipulation of records and contacts. Available options differ depending on whether the item is being viewed or edited.

Options available when viewing or editing:

* **Copy**: The copy button makes a duplicate of a record or contact.
  > ![](/assets/NoteSmall.png)**Note**: Making a copy will generate a new ID for the copied record and be named “Copy of …”. All the other info will remain the same including associations. The “metadata identifier” is NOT copied but any identifiers in the main citation WILL be copied, including any ScienceBase IDs.
*  **Delete**: The delete button will completely delete the record or contact.  
  > ![](/assets/BestPracticeSmall.png)Best Practice: Make a backup of your record or contact before deleting. Consult the [**Export**](/export.md)** **section of this manual to learn how to make a backup.
