# Contact New

## Create a New Contact from Scratch

1. Click on plus \(![](/assets/symbol_plus_16.png)\) sign by “**Contacts**”.
2. Specify if the contact is an **Individual** or an **Organization.**
3. The **Contact ID **is auto generated by mdEditor.
4. For an individual:
   -You must specify either name or position name \(or both\).
5. For an organization:
   -You must specify name.

## Completing Contact Information

### For Individuals only

* **Individual name**: Required
* **Position name**: Optional
* **Member of Organization**: Recommended
* **Note: **You can make an individual part of multiple organizations

### For Organizations only

* **Organization Name**: Required

### For Individuals AND Organizations

* **Contact Type**: Required
* **Email address**: Required
* **Physical address**: Recommended    
* **Logo**: Optional
  -**Note: Users **can either select or drop image that will be used for logos. If load an image, will create a URI and has a size limit. If have a larger image, link to it rather than load into mdEditor.
   If your contact contains a logo, you must include a filename for the logo or else you will get an error on your metadata records that include that contact.
* If an organization has a logo associated with it, individuals will inherit the logos from the organization    

### General notes on Contacts

* Copying contacts will change the ID and the name \(the name will be “Copy of ….”\) but all the other info will be the same.
* When you edit a contact, the information will also update the metadata records that include that contact and update to SB when you publish the records.
* Best management practice: It is safest to export all contacts whenever you export a project/product.
