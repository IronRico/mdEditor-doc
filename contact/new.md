# Contact New

## Create a New Contact

1. Click the plus \(![](/assets/symbol_plus_16.png)\) sign by **Contacts**.
2. Specify if the contact is an **Individual** or an **Organization.**
3. The **Contact ID **is auto generated by mdEditor.
4. For an individual: You must specify either name or position name \(or both\).
5. For an organization: You must specify name.

For Organizations only

* **Organization Name**: Required

### For Individuals AND Organizations

* **Contact Type**: Required
* **Email address**: Required
* **Physical address**: Recommended    
* **Logo**: Optional
  > **Note**:** **Users** **can either select or drop an image that will be used for a logo. Images loaded into mdEditor must be smaller than 50kb and recommended size is smaller than 25kb. If a larger image is necessary, link to it rather than load into mdEditor. If your contact contains a logo, you must include a filename for the logo or else you will get an error on your metadata records that include that contact. If an organization has a logo associated with it, individuals will inherit the logos from the organization.
