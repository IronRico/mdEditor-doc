Editing options include:

* **Save**: Used to save changes. 
  > ![](/assets/note_small.png) Save can only be used if auto-save is turned off and a change has been made. Consult the [**Settings**](/settings.md)** **section of this manual for more information.
* **Cancel**: Used to undo changes that have not yet been saved.

* **Copy**: The copy button makes a duplicate of a contact.

* **Delete**: The delete button will completely delete the contact.

  > ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice**: Make a backup of your contact\(s\) before deleting. Consult the [**Export**](/export.md)** **section of this manual to learn how to make a backup.
