mdEditor.json files can be exported and imported via mdEditor's built in **Export** and **Import **functionality \(described in the [Export](/export.md) and [Import](/import.md) section of this manual\).

> ![](/assets/note_small.png)The only way to backup your records is by using the [Export](/export.md) functionality.
>
> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice**: It is recommended that you use the [Export](/export.md) functionality frequently to a local computer folder of your choosing. It is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor's **Clear Storage Cache **functionality. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn more.
>
> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice**: In order to keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on, and then export one project \(and its related products and contacts\) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that their organization uses to organize data.
>
> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png) **Best practice: **Work on project-by-project basis.
>
> > > > 1. Save each project and affiliated products together as a set. To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, then select the appropriate records \(i.e., the target project and its affiliated products\) and then click “Export Selected.” Consult the [**Export**](/export.md)** **section of this manual to learn more about export functionality.

> > > >    ![](/assets/note_small.png) **Note**: When exporting projects and products, export all of your contacts .
>
> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice**: Leave your contacts in mdEditor all the time so they’re always available.
> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice**: Leave your dictionaries in mdEditor all the time so they’re always available.
> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice**: Maintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor \(or switch browsers, URLs, etc.\).
> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice**: Set up a metadata directory so you can always find the metadata file.
> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice**: Export all contacts together \(unless you’re comfortable knowing exactly which contacts are used in your record set\), otherwise if you load a project and the contacts aren’t loaded in mdEditor, you can’t inject the contacts back into the metadata record.
> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice**: Save mdEditor contacts at the end of every work session, load before each work session and ensure they are up to date. Then load the project/product record you want to work on.
