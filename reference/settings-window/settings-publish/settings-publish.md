Incorporated into mdEditor's design is the ability to export metadata records directly to metadata repositories and clearing houses that support an "Application Program Interface" (API).  These APIs are designed, written, and maintained by the repository, not by ADIwg mdEditor.  To accomplish the interface, mdEditor must implement the repository's API.

At this time the only supported repository is "ScienceBase", the United States Geological Survey's data repository.  Because setup and interface rules are different for each repository they are discussed individually.
