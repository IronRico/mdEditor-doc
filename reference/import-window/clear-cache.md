# Reference -- Import Records 

### Clearing Browser Cache

---

When importing metadata records to mdEditor there are times when completely clearing the browser cache can be helpful.  If your import is replacing items of each type (<span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span>, <span class="md-panel">Contact</span>, and <span class="md-panel">Dictionary</span>) mdEditor will effectively be clearing browser cache for you.  In other instances you may need to do this yourself.  

{% hint style='danger' %}
  **Warning:** Clearing all records will delete all of the records currently loaded in mdEditor. Before doing so, use the Export function to make a backup of your records. Otherwise, the records will be permanently lost (unless you previously made a backup copy).

 {% hint style='warning' %}
 Note than when you clear the browser cache mdEditor (<span class="md-section">Settings</span> <span class="md-panel">General Settings</span>), the option to keep your local settings is available. The option to “Keep Settings” is checked by default. This ensures that you will not lose your local settings unless you _uncheck_ the box prior to using the <span class="btn btn-danger btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-times"></i> Clear Storage Cache</span> button.
