# Import Records 
### Import Window
--- 

![Import Panel](/assets/reference/import/import-window.png)

The <span class="md-window">Import</span> window is divided into four panels: <span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span>, <span class="md-panel">Contacts</span>, <span class="md-panel"> Dictionaries</span>, and <span class="md-panel">Settings</span>.  Each of these panes has identical controls and behavior.  So, what is discussed for one applies to all.  In the above image the <span class="md-panel"> Dictionaries</span> and <span class="md-panel"> Settings</span> panels are not shown, but as previously stated, there is no difference in behavior from the two which are shown.

{% include "../include-objects/view-obj.md" %}
    
  * #### <span class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-binoculars"> </i> Preview JSON</span> Show mdEditor JSON
  
  The 'Preview JSON' button opens a new window and displays the selected item's JSON.  The view is neither in strict mdEditor JSON or mdJSON format, but something in between.  You can use this view to examine details of <span class="md-panel"> Metadata Records</span>, <span class="md-panel"> Contacts</span>, <span class="md-panel"> Data Dictionaries</span>, and <span class="md-panel"> Settings</span> prior to import.

    * ##### Record ID
    
      The "Record ID' is the mdEditor record id of the item selected for JSON preview.  This will match the ID shown in the <span class="md-window"> Import</span> window's selection panels. 
      
    * ##### JSON Window
    
      In the above image the hierarchial JSON sections are shown collapsed (or folded).  To view the full record detail click the '+' (plus sign) on the "Expand/Collapse Sections" button.
