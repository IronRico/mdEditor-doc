# Metadata Record -- Taxonomy Section
---

THE taxonomy SECTION DOCUMENTATION WILL BE COMPLETED AFTER ADDITIONAL mdEditor FEATURES HAVE BEEN ADDED.

The <span class="md-section">Taxonomy</span> section of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> is used to define taxonomic hierarchies.  The mdEditor implementation allows multiple entries to be defined at any hierarchy level.  Additionally, branching is permitted at any level of the hierarchy.  This flexibility in defining taxonomies is the reason mdEditor uses the term <span class="md-panel">Taxonomic Collection</span>.

When no <span class="md-panel">Taxonomic Collections</span> have been defined for the <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> a large blue bar is displayed on the page declaring "No taxonomic collections found."
