# Metadata Record -- Keyword Section
---

The <span class="md-section">Keywords</span> section of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> is used to define keyword sets for the main resource.  Each <span class="md-panel">Keyword Set</span> is associated with a <span class="md-panel">Keyword Thesaurus</span> which references the master dictionary from which the individual <span class="md-element">Keywords</span> were selected.  

When no <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> lists have been defined for the <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> a large blue bar is displayed on the page declaring "No keywords found."

 Two types of <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> lists may be specified: *predefined* and *custom*.  Thesaurus information for predefined thesauri is inserted by mdEditor and cannot be changed, the elements have been disabled.  Likewise, the keywords from predefined lists must be selected from lists provided by mdEditor and cannot be extended.  
 
 Conversely, custom thesauri require the user to enter both the thesaurus information and keywords.
 
 The <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> panels may be collapsed to de-clutter the window by clicking the 'collapse panel icon' on the upper right corner of the panel.  Once collapsed, they can be expanded again by reversing the process.
