# Metadata Record -- Keyword Section
---

THE keyword SECTION DOCUMENTATION WILL BE COMPLETED AFTER ADDITIONAL mdEditor FEATURES HAVE BEEN ADDED.

The <span class="md-section">Keyword</span> section of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> is used to define keyword sets for the main resource.  Each <span class="md-panel">Keyword Set</span> is associated with a <span class="md-panel">Keyword Thesaurus</span> which references the master dictionary from which individual <span class="md-element">Keywords</span> were selected.  

When no <span class="md-panel">Keyword Thesauri</span> have been defined for the <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> a large blue bar is displayed on the page declaring "No keywords found."
