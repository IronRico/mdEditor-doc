# Metadata Record -- Extent Section
---

THE extent SECTION DOCUMENTATION WILL BE COMPLETED AFTER ADDITIONAL mdEditor FEATURES HAVE BEEN ADDED.

The <span class="md-section">Extent</span> section of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> is used to define geographic, temporal, and vertical extents for the main resource.  <span class="md-panel">Geographic Extents</span> set spatial boundaries which encompass the main resource.  These can be defined as a simple bounding box or complex polygons.  <span class="md-panel">Temporal Extents</span> set time periods or specific instants for which the main resource is relevant.  <span class="md-panel">Vertical Extents</span> define the vertical span of the main resource as altitude, elevation, or depth.

When no <span class="md-panel">Extents</span> have been defined for the <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> a large blue bar is displayed on the page declaring "No geographic extents found."  

{% hint style='info' %}
  Note only geographic extents are implemented in mdEditor.  Temporal and vertical are coming soon.
{% endhint %}
