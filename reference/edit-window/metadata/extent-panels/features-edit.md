![Geographic Extent Features Edit Window](/assets/reference/edit-objects/metadata/extent/features-edit.png){caption}

All geographic <span class="md-panel">Features</span> can edited on the map whether they were initially drawn or imported, the editing process is the same.  

#### Locate Feature

The first step in editing a <span class="md-panel">Feature</span> is to locate the feature.  This can be done directly on the map or using the <span class="md-window">Feature List</span> near the bottom of the window. 

##### Select from Feature List

* As the mouse rolls over lines on the <span class="md-window">Feature List</span> the corresponding <span class="md-panel">Feature</span> is highlighted on the map.  

* <strong class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-search"> </i> </strong> If the <span class="md-panel">Feature</span> isn't in the current map display area, click the <strong class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-search"> </i> </strong> button to center the map on the feature.  The map will also zoom to best show the feature.

  {% hint style='danger' %}
 When centering in on points, the map zooms to a scale of 300 meters.  However, map tiles only display to a maximum resolution of 500 meters.  Therefore the map detail is lost and a gray background replaces the map.  To regain map detail simply zoom out a level to 500 meters or greater.
  {% endhint %}
  
* <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i> </strong> Click to enter edit mode on the <span class="md-panel">Feature</span>.  

* <strong class="btn btn-danger btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-times"> </i> </strong> Click to delete the <span class="md-panel">Feature</span>. 

  {% hint style='danger' %}
 There is no confirmation option before delete!  
  {% endhint %}
  
##### Select from Map

To select a <span class="md-panel">Feature</span> on the map for editing double click the feature.  For polygons this can be anywhere inside the polygon.  

{% hint style='tip' %}
  Double clicking to select a line can be tricky, especially if it falls within a polygon, the polygon always seems to get priority.  When having trouble selecting features directly from the map try the <span class="md-window">Feature List</span> instead.
