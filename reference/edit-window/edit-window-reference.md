# Reference -- Edit Window

In mdEditor, <span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span> are created, edited, and maintained separately.  This normalized approach to the editor and record management allows the metadata author the flexibility to combine and reuse individual parts when creating subsequent metadata records.
