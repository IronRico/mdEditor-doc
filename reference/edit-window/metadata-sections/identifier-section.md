# Metadata Record -- Identifier Section
DO NOT EDIT

The <span class="md-section">Identifier</span> section is not directly accessible from the <span class="md-window">Secondary Navigation Bar</span> like other <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections.  Because a typical metadata record needs to cite many different resources, the <span class="md-panel">Identifier</span> view panel for each cited resource has been programmed to handle access to the <span class="md-section">Identifier</span> edit window for you.
