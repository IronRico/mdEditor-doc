# Metadata Record -- Identifier Section
---

The <span class="md-section">Identifier</span> section is not directly accessible from the <span class="md-window">Secondary Navigation Bar</span> like other <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections.  Because a typical metadata record needs to reference many different identifiers, mdEditor has chosen to use the same <span class="md-panel">Identifier</span> object editor to edit all identifier objects.  You arrive at the <span class="md-section"> Identifier</span> edit page automatically when you choose to edit an <span class="md-panel"> Identifier</span> object from anywhere in mdEditor.   

 Throughout mdEditor, when not viewing the <span class="md-panel"> Identifier</span> object from the <span class="md-section">Identifier</span> page an overview of the full object will be displayed. When the metadata record is exported or translated the full <span class="md-panel">Identifier</span> object will always be used.  

<strong class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-arrow-left"> </i> Back to ...</strong> Click 'Back To' in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span> to end editing of the <span class="md-panel">Identifier</span> and return to the mdEditor section you were on before entering the <span class="md-section">Identifier</span>.
