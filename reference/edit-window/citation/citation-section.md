# Reference -- Citation Section
---

The <span class="md-section">Citation</span> <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> is accessed from many locations throughout mdEditor.  This is because a typical metadata record will reference many different resources.  For example, these resources might be of earlier or referenced works, data domains, or taxonomic systems in addition to a required main resource for the metadata record.  Each of these resources is represented by a separate <span class="md-panel">Citation</span> object each having identical structure and complement of elements.  

How you actually arrive at the <span class="md-section">Citation</span> <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> will vary, but the mdEditor elements and rules outlined in this reference section will apply in all situations. 

{% hint style='info' %}
  If you clicked <strong class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i>Edit</strong> to gain access to the <span class="md-panel">Citation</span> object there will be a <strong class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-arrow-left"> </i> Back to ...</strong> button in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.  Click this button to end editing of the <span class="md-panel">Citation</span> and return to the mdEditor section you were on before entering the <span class="md-section">Citation</span> <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>.
{% endhint %}
