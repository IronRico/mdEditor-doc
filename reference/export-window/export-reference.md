# Export Record 
DO NOT EDIT

The export function allows the contents of the currently loaded metadata records, contacts, and dictionaries to be saved as either as an mdEditor file or mdJSON file. These files can then be shared with collaborators or saved to a local workstation for backup or archival. 

By default, exported files will be saved in your computers "downloads" folder.  This default can be changed in your browser's settings generally under the "Downloads" topic.  

{% hint style='info' %}
  Because mdEditor is a web application (runs in an internet browser) exports from mdEditor are treated as downloads even though the metadata record is already on your computer.  The download is from browser cache to computer's file system
{% endhint %} 

The file name given to the export follows the form "mdEditor-" (for an mdEditor file) or "mdJson" (for an mdJson file) followed by a timestamp and type of "json".  For example an mdEditor file exported at 2:14 p.m. on November 21, 2018 would have the name "mdEditor-20181121-141126.json".  Note the timestamp is written in two sections using the format YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.  The files can be freely renamed to fit your requirements.  Just make the sure to keep the format suffix of ".json".  It is not necessary to keep the default format in order to re-import the file to mdEditor at a later time.

The <span class="md-window">Export</span> window is divided into three panels: <span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span>, <span class="md-panel">Contacts</span>, and <span class="md-panel"> Dictionaries</span>.  Each of these panes has the same controls and behavior.  What is discussed for one applies to all.
